#Goals
#Learn about Tkinter and how to use it to create GUI
#Previously had to use command line interface (CLI)/command line operating system (ex. MS-DOS)
#Big deal back in the 1990s
#MS-DOS is similar to our Python Console where we have to write a piece of text
#GUIs are graphical accompanied with a mouse 
#Required very little training with computers
#One of earliest examples of GUI interface was the MAC Lisa
#Windows 95 was Microsoft's version of GUI, when it first came out it caused controversy because it appeared to have stolen Apple's IP
#Both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates benefitted from Xerox Parc work in creating GUI.
#Steve hired Bob Belville
#Gates hired Charles Simonyi
#Their work showed the way that led to the Mac and Windows
#Xerox Parc also created Ethernet (LAN) Object Oriented Program (OOP, Smalltalk-80) and the GUI, developed the first Mouse
#Movie of this story - Pirates of Silicon Valley 1999
#We're going to learn Tkinter so we are no longer reliant on console/text based programs also not working within playpen of turtle module
